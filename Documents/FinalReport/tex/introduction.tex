As a recap, our project, C7FIT is an iOS health app built for the local Portland gym, Club Seven Fitness. This project is built in collaboration with eBay's mobile team located in Portland as well. The roles of our clients included providing mentorship along with code reviews, assets, and resources for our needs. The application's purpose is to allow customers of a gym to easily be able to access their health information already on their iPhones as well as integrate that data into something that will help them work with trainers at Club Seven Fitness. Our goal for this application was to build something that would be an effective tool to do such that. Group members include Brandon Lee – Team Leader, Michael Lee – Developer, and Rutger Farry – Developer.
