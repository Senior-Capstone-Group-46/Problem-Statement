\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Communication was a bit rough as clients and students were using email
  for half of the week before switching to Slack.
\item
  Additionally clients and students have not met up in person yet to
  discuss details of the project, so as of right now some details are
  still vague due to the broad scope of specifications.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Progress}\label{progress}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Wrote Problem Statement.
\item
  Created GitHub Organization and repo.
\item
  Created Slack for remote communication.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Next week Wednesday we are planning to go up to Portland to discuss
  further details about the app with clients at eBay in person.
\item
  I plan to catch up on learning up a bit on some iOS concepts in the
  extra time before we formally begin.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Problems}\label{problems}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Since we're still just ramping up, currently still blocked on not
  having an exact direction to proceed in terms of app architecture and
  design. Need to confirm major requirements in accordance with these
  core principles. Will be sitting down with fellow students this
  weekend and discussing this weekend.
\item
  Communication still seems to be slow as not many people (clients and
  students) seem to be using the Slack, so communication as of currently
  is still just a mixture of emails and Slack.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Progress}\label{progress}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Visited eBay Portland in person to discuss details and iron out plans.
\item
  Got a clearer idea of what is required by the clients in terms of app
  functionality and features.
\item
  Created a

  page with useful links.

  Received back Problem Statement, will update and turn in by Monday.

\item
  Busy week for both students and clients. Was not able to obtain an
  updated list of functional requirements until Thursday night, the
  night before the Requirements Document rough draft due.
\item
  Difficulty organizing time to collectively work together as students
  on Problem Statement and Requirements Document due to scattered
  midterm schedules.

\paragraph{If you were to redo the project from Fall term, what would
you tell
yourself?}\label{if-you-were-to-redo-the-project-from-fall-term-what-would-you-tell-yourself}
I would tell myself to get started earlier, ask for more code reviews
from our client, and delegate work more evenly.
\paragraph{What's the biggest skill you've
learned?}\label{whats-the-biggest-skill-youve-learned}
I've learned a bunch on how to organize a team towards completing an
objective. In addition, I realized how the software development process
changes as we move away from school and more towards real world
development.
\paragraph{What skills do you see yourself using in the
future?}\label{what-skills-do-you-see-yourself-using-in-the-future}
I see myself using the skills I've learned here in iOS development a lot
in the real world as an aspiring mobile developer. Namely, all things
iOS, Swift, and Objective-C.
\paragraph{What did you like about the project, and what did you
not?}\label{what-did-you-like-about-the-project-and-what-did-you-not}
I liked how it was a mobile development project rather than either web
development or research as this is where my interests are. One thing I
didn't like about this project was how it was so geared towards writing.
There was way too much written objectives versus actual development, the
ratio could've easily been much better.
\paragraph{What did you learn from your
teammates?}\label{what-did-you-learn-from-your-teammates}
I learned that it can be challenging working with others. But as long as
everyone's consistently on the same page, it can definitely help in
alleviating this struggle.
\paragraph{If you were the client for this project, would you be
satisfied with the work
done?}\label{if-you-were-the-client-for-this-project-would-you-be-satisfied-with-the-work-done}
Yes. As this is a student college project with the work done essentially
for free and the base requirements being met, I'd say that the
objectives have been satisfied.
\paragraph{If your project were to be continued next year, what do you
think needs to be working
on?}\label{if-your-project-were-to-be-continued-next-year-what-do-you-think-needs-to-be-working-on}
More refinement, particularly in the UI state animations and towards the
services side.
