As we used the Swift language, we spent a lot of time on the Apple website reading their documentation. The most helpful resource was their documentation on HealthKit, MapKit, and Swift 3 (the newest version of the language). Ray Wenderlich is one of the primary guide and tutorial creators for iOS development. He had blog posts that provided tons of examples which helped us greatly in learning the basics. Finally, Stack Overflow was able to solve any of our more common problems.

\subsection{What, if any, reference books really helped?}
We didnâ€™t use any reference books for iOS development, as the Swift language is fairly new in itself most of the prevalent information was available on the Internet.

\subsection{Were there any people on campus that were really helpful?}
The go-to people for this project were mainly our group mates. Two of us were part of the OSU App club, and so they all had experience with this sort of development before. Other than that we worked with a team of developers at eBay, our client, so they were our second source of help as they had years of experience. There wasn't really a go to on campus for such specific help.
