\subsection{Design Document Changes}
The biggest change we encountered while working on our senior project was the removal of MINDBODY functionality when working on our app. The ability to schedule and pay for appointments using the MINDBODY API was going to be a significant portion of the app, but we determined in December that it was going to be unfeasibly expensive to pay for the MINDBODY service.

Luckily for our group, the design direction that our client wanted to take was already accounted for in our plans. Their decision was to replace the scrapped MINDBODY functionality with our stretch goal of implementing a fitness shop using the eBay API. Since this was a stretch goal for our project, it was already noted in our design documents and we had already drawn up wireframes for the proposed eBay fitness shop. Therefore, switching directions in this way was relatively painless and only entailed removing MINDBODY from our design documents and rearranging the tab bar to include a button for the eBay fitness shop.
